  <string name="andNowTheLongAnswerLagComposedOfTwoValues">And now, the long answer! Game lag is composed of two unrelated values (lower is better):</string>
  <string name="playstrategyServerLatency">Playstrategy server latency</string>
  <string name="playstrategyServerLatencyExplanation">The time it takes to process a move on the server. It's the same for everybody, and only depends on the server load. The more players and the higher it gets, but Playstrategy developers do their best to keep it low. It rarely exceeds 10ms.</string>
  <string name="networkBetweenPlaystrategyAndYou">Network between Playstrategy and you</string>
  <string name="networkBetweenPlaystrategyAndYouExplanation">The time it takes to send a move from your computer to Playstrategy server, and get the response back.

  <string name="lagCompensation">Lag compensation</string>
  <string name="lagCompensationExplanation">Playstrategy compensates network lag. This includes sustained lag and occasional lag spikes. There are limits and heuristics based on time control and the compensated lag so far, so that the result should feel reasonable for both players. As a result, having a higher network lag than your opponent is not a handicap!</string>
