ui/build was lovingly crafted from a single block of wood as a personal gift to you.

  ./build <options> <modules> # modules are top level directories in ui
  one letter options can be consolidated after a single dash (e.g. -cdw)
  ui/build can be run from anywhere, does not care about cwd

Options:
  --clean             clean build artifacts and exit
  -c, --clean-build   clean build artifacts then build
  -d, --debug         build assets with site.debug = true
  -p, --prod          build minified assets (prod builds)
  -w, --watch         build, watch for changes, but terminate on package.json changes
  -r, --rebuild       build, watch, and rebuild on package.json changes
  -n, --no-install    don't run pnpm install (--no-install is incompatible with --rebuild)
  --no-color          don't use color in logs
  --no-time           don't log the time
  --no-context        don't log the context
  --update            rebuild ui/build (not performed in normal builds, not even clean ones)
  --tsc               run tsc, any of [--tsc, --sass, --esbuild, --copies] will disable the others
  --sass              run sass
  --esbuild           run esbuild
  --copies            run copies

Examples:
  ./build --clean            # clean only
  ./build -c                 # clean build artifacts then build everything
  ./build -rc                # recommended for maintainers - clean build, watch, clean rebuild
  ./build -d                 # build client assets with site.debug = true
  ./build -np                # no pnpm install, build minified
  ./build -cp                # clean, build minified
  ./build analyse site msg   # build analyse, site, and msg modules (as opposed to everything)
  ./build -r dasher chart    # watch mode for dasher and chart modules
  ./build --tsc -w           # watch mode but type checking only
  ./build --sass msg notify  # build css only for msg and notify modules
